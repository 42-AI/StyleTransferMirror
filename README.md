# StyleTransferMirror
The goal of this project is to have a mirror that display the styled transfer image of the reflection in real time.

This work will be based on this paper :

[*Arbitrary Style Transfer with Style-Attentional Networks*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02342.pdf)

to train with the same data as the pretrain network, or to train more, unzip `wikiart.zip` and `train2017.zip`. Move the images to the folders, respectively, `style` and `content`
